# Revalidation (ISR)

For SSR and [Pages mode](../pages-routing/overview) projects, Void supports stale-while-revalidate caching for dynamically rendered pages. Cached pages are served instantly from the edge while the worker re-renders in the background when the cache is stale. This is the equivalent of [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) in other frameworks.

This requires [SSR](../ssr.md) or [Pages mode](../pages-routing/overview) to be configured.

## Enabling revalidation

Add a `routing.revalidate` field to `void.json` with a TTL in seconds:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "revalidate": 60
  }
}
```

Setting `revalidate` to `0` disables revalidation (equivalent to plain SSR).

## Per-path revalidation

You can set different TTLs for different URL patterns using an object:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "revalidate": {
      "/": 60,
      "/docs/*": 31536000,
      "/user/*": 0,
      "*": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Rules are matched in order, and the first match wins. The `*` glob matches any characters including `/`.

Special values:

- `31536000` (1 year): effectively cached until the next deploy, since deploys clear the ISR cache
- `0`: never cached and always rendered by the worker, which is equivalent to plain SSR for that path

## Per-page revalidation (Pages mode)

In [Pages mode](../pages-routing/overview), you can export a `revalidate` value from a `.server.ts` file to override the global config for that page:

```ts
// pages/products/index.server.ts
export const revalidate = 120; // cache for 2 minutes

export const loader = defineHandler(async (c) => {
  // ...
});
```

Per-page values take precedence over `void.json` patterns.

## Precedence

When multiple sources set a revalidate TTL, the most specific wins:

1. `x-revalidate` response header (per-response)
2. `.server.ts` export (per-page, Pages mode only)
3. `void.json` `routing.revalidate` path pattern match
4. `void.json` `routing.revalidate` global number or `"*"` fallback

## How revalidation works

1. **First request:** there is no cache entry yet. The worker renders the page, returns the response, and writes the result to KV in the background.

2. **Subsequent requests (fresh):** the cached response is served from the edge cache or KV. No worker call is needed.

3. **Subsequent requests (stale):** the stale cached response is served immediately, and the worker re-renders in the background. The next request gets the fresh version.

This means users never wait for a stale page to re-render. They always get an immediate response.

## Per-response TTL override

Route handlers can set the `x-revalidate` response header to override the TTL for a specific response:

```ts
export const GET = defineHandler(async (c) => {
  // Don't cache this particular response
  c.header('x-revalidate', '0');

  return c.html('...');
});
```

- `x-revalidate: 0`: skip caching for this response
- `x-revalidate: 300`: cache for 5 minutes instead of the default

Only successful responses (2xx) are cached.

## Cache bypass

Requests with `Cookie` or `Authorization` headers bypass the ISR cache entirely and always dispatch to the worker. This ensures personalized or authenticated pages are never served from a shared cache.

## Cache keys and rewrites

If a request is rewritten at dispatch (`routing.rewrites`, `routing.fallbacks`, or `_redirects` 200/200!), the ISR cache slot is keyed on the **rewritten** pathname **plus** the original request URL's pathname. Query parameters are dropped from rewrite variant keys by default; use `routing.revalidateQueryAllowlist` to keep selected query params when they should vary cached output. So a direct request to `/en/docs/foo` and a rewrite from `/docs/foo → /en/docs/foo` no longer share a slot — each renders and caches independently. Middleware `c.rewrite()` runs after ISR lookup, so it observes rewrite metadata but does not create a separate ISR variant.

`revalidate({ paths })` operates on the rewritten pathname (the slot's primary key). Purging `/en/docs/foo` removes **all variants** (direct + every rewrite source) under that path. Purging the source path (`/docs/foo`) invalidates nothing, because no slot was ever written under it.

**Migration note:** the ISR cache key format bumped to a versioned `v2` prefix alongside this feature, with no reader-side fallback to the previous unversioned format. The first time a project deploys on the new dispatch, **every** pre-existing ISR entry becomes unreachable — not only paths that gained a rewrite rule. Cache slots warm up normally under the new key as traffic comes in; you'll see a one-time cache-miss wave proportional to your traffic × TTL, then the hit rate returns to normal. No manual purge is required, and the stranded entries expire on their own via their original TTLs and deployment age-out. Additionally, if you introduce a rewrite on an existing path (e.g. `/docs/foo` → `/en/docs/foo`), the cache slot for that path moves to the rewritten pathname, so the source path's `v2` slot will cold-start too.

## On-demand revalidation

You can purge ISR cache entries programmatically from a route handler:

```ts
import { revalidate } from 'void/isr';

export const POST = defineHandler(async (c) => {
  // ... update content in database ...

  // Purge specific pages
  await revalidate({ paths: ['/', '/blog/hello-world'] });

  // Or purge all cached pages
  await revalidate({ all: true });

  return c.json({ ok: true });
});
```
