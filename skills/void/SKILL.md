# Void Skill

This skill is a router. Open the minimum relevant docs files under `docs/` and execute.

Docs in this skill are bundled from `docs/` during `void` package build and live at:

- `skills/void/docs/**/*.md`

## Command Naming

Use `void` in examples and commands in this skill. For first-time setup, prefer `void init` followed by `void deploy`; in an empty directory, install `void` first and let `void init` add the matching Pages adapter and starter dependencies with Vite+ as the default scaffold toolchain. In an existing app, `void init` configures Void in place by adding missing Vite scripts and creating or patching `vite.config.*` with `voidPlugin()`. `void init` can also handle auth and project linking interactively.

Use `void` and `@void/*` in code examples and package manifests.

## No-Args Behavior

If invoked without a concrete task, do a brief app status check and report:

1. App type (`void`, `framework`, `spa`, `static`) using `docs/app-types.md` criteria.
2. Backend feature usage (`routes/`, `pages/`, `middleware/`, `migrations/`, `crons/`, `queues/`, SSR entries).
3. Runtime signals (`void/db`, `void/kv`, `void/storage`, queue usage).
4. Auth signals (`void/auth`, `auth` client imports, OAuth env vars).
5. Project linkage (`.void/project.json`) and config readiness (`void.json`, tsconfig extends).
6. Optional health checks (`void auth whoami`, `void db status` when relevant).

Then ask what to do next.

## Working Rules

- For any task involving running `void` commands — including checking status, managing secrets, viewing logs, or deploying — open `docs/reference/cli.md` FIRST. Do not guess command syntax.
- Never guess or infer `void` CLI command names or flags. Always consult `docs/reference/cli.md` for the exact command before running it.
- For multi-topic tasks, combine only the needed doc files.
- If docs and memory differ, follow docs.
- **Env vars:** When the project has `env.ts`, the canonical access pattern is `import { env } from "void/env"`. Declare every env key in `env.ts` via `defineEnv({...})` so values are typed and validated. Do not introduce ad-hoc `process.env.X` or untyped `c.env.X` access in new code — add the key to `env.ts` first.
