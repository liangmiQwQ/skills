# Meta-Frameworks

Use this section when your app already has a framework that owns routing and rendering. Void does not try to replace that layer. Instead, it plugs into the Vite build and deployment pipeline so you still get the platform features that matter on the backend.

Void supports deploying meta-framework apps with `void deploy`. Add `voidPlugin()` to your framework's Vite config to get binding inference, typed DB generation, migration management, cron jobs, queues, and caching.

Some frameworks, such as TanStack Start and React Router, compose directly with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, which Void already covers. Others, such as SvelteKit, Nuxt, Analog, and Astro, bring their own Cloudflare integrations. In both cases, the framework stays in charge of routing and rendering. Void handles the platform-facing pieces around it.

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework                                           | Package                 | Integration                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) | `@tanstack/react-start` | Vite plugin composition. `voidPlugin()` runs alongside the framework plugin. |
| [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)         | `@react-router/dev`     | Vite plugin composition. Setup matches TanStack Start.                       |
| [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit)            | `@sveltejs/kit`         | Vite-based, uses its own Cloudflare adapter                                  |
| [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)                           | `nuxt`                  | Own CLI and build toolchain                                                  |
| [Analog](https://analogjs.org/)                     | `@analogjs/platform`    | Vite-based, uses Nitro with Cloudflare preset                                |
| [Astro **v6+**](https://astro.build/)               | `astro`                 | Own CLI and Cloudflare adapter (v6 required)                                 |

Detection is automatic. The CLI reads your `package.json` dependencies.

See the individual framework guides for setup instructions:

- [TanStack Start](./tanstack-start.md)
- [React Router](./react-router.md)
- [SvelteKit](./sveltekit.md)
- [Nuxt](./nuxt.md)
- [Analog](./analog.md)
- [Astro](./astro.md)

## Feature Support

With `voidPlugin()` added to the framework's Vite config, frameworks get most of the same backend/platform features as [Void apps](../../guide/app-types.md#void-apps):

- **Binding inference:** D1, KV, R2, AI, and queues are detected from source code.
- **Typed database:** query helpers are generated from `db/migrations/*.sql`.
- **Migrations:** local D1 is updated on dev startup, and migrations are validated and deployed with `void deploy`.
- **Runtime helpers:** `void/db`, `void/kv`, `void/storage`, and `void/ai` give you typed access to Cloudflare bindings in dev and production.
- **Auth:** Void-managed auth is not supported in framework mode yet. For now, use Better Auth's official integration for your framework.
- **Cron jobs:** scheduled handlers via the `crons/` directory.
- **Queue consumers:** typed producers and consumers via the `queues/` directory.
- **Revalidation and prerendering:** configure them with [`routing.revalidate`](../../guide/edge/revalidation.md) and [`routing.prerender`](../../guide/edge/prerendering.md) in `void.json`. Void apps can also set these per page in component files.

Frameworks can also access bindings directly via the framework's own mechanisms (e.g. `platform.env` in SvelteKit, `event.context.cloudflare.env` in Nuxt, `env` from `cloudflare:workers` in Analog, `Astro.locals.runtime.env` in Astro).

## Configuration

### `void.json`

Most configuration is inferred automatically. Use `void.json` to override defaults or fine-tune behavior:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/void/schema.json",
  "inference": {
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "scanDirs": ["src", "server", "lib"],
    "bindings": { "db": "MY_DB" }
  },
  "routing": {
    "prerender": ["/", "/about", "/pricing"],
    "revalidate": 60
  }
}
```

| Field                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inference.build`    | Override the default build command                                                                                                                            |
| `inference.scanDirs` | Directories to scan for binding inference (defaults vary by framework)                                                                                        |
| `routing.prerender`  | Paths to prerender as static HTML at deploy time                                                                                                              |
| `routing.revalidate` | Default revalidation TTL in seconds for cached responses                                                                                                      |
| `inference.bindings` | Override inferred bindings. You only need this if auto-detection is not doing what you want. Accepts `true` or a custom binding name such as `"db": "MY_DB"`. |

See [Configuration](../../reference/config.md) for the full reference.

### `wrangler.jsonc`

Frameworks that use Cloudflare's dev runtime for local dev (SvelteKit, Nuxt with `nitro-cloudflare-dev`, Astro) need a `wrangler.jsonc` for binding configuration. `voidPlugin()` auto-syncs inferred bindings into this file on dev startup:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-02-24",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  // Bindings below are auto-managed by voidPlugin()
}
```

Existing bindings are preserved. Only missing ones are added with local placeholder IDs.

For `void deploy`, compatibility settings are read from `wrangler.jsonc` automatically (no need to duplicate them in `void.json`).

## Deploy Pipeline

SvelteKit, Nuxt, Analog, and Astro apps follow this pipeline:

```
void deploy
  │
  ├─ 1. Detect framework
  │    Reads package.json → determines framework + output conventions
  │
  ├─ 2. Build
  │    Runs framework's build command (or void.json `build` override)
  │    SvelteKit: vite build → .svelte-kit/cloudflare/
  │    Nuxt:      nuxt build → .output/
  │    Analog:    vite build → dist/analog/
  │    Astro:     astro build → dist/
  │
  ├─ 3. Analyze
  │    ├─ Locate worker entry + static assets from known output paths
  │    ├─ Infer bindings from source or read from void.json
  │    ├─ Collect migrations from db/migrations/*.sql
  │    ├─ Detect cron and queue handlers
  │    └─ Read wrangler.jsonc compat settings
  │
  ├─ 4. Wrap (if needed)
  │    If crons or queues are configured:
  │    ├─ Generate wrapper entry module
  │    ├─ Bundle with Vite (wraps framework's worker)
  │    └─ Wrapper adds scheduled/queue handlers
  │
  ├─ 5. Package + upload
  │    Same as full-stack: hash-based asset diffing,
  │    multipart upload, platform provisioning
  │
  └─ 6. Live
       https://my-app.void.app
```
