## Overview

cc-design embeds a structured design workflow into Claude Code, enabling it to operate as an expert product designer. Three core principles guide every task:

- **Fact verification (P0)** — Never guess. Verify claims about design trends, brand aesthetics, or technology. Wrong facts are worse than no facts.
- **Batch questions first (P1)** — For new ambiguous design tasks, start with one batch of clarifying questions. Skip that only for minor fixes, follow-up iterations, explicit speed requests, or already-rich briefs.
- **Anti-AI slop (P2)** — Aggressive gradients, emoji (unless brand), generic SaaS hero sections, and overused fonts are banned. Full rules in `references/content-guidelines.md`.

Progressive disclosure keeps the main skill definition concise while 27+ technical references load on demand.

The core product promise is behavioral, not just feature breadth:
- new ambiguous tasks start with one batch of clarifying questions
- richly specified briefs can skip straight to a first pass with explicit assumptions
- explicit speed requests can skip straight to a first pass with explicit assumptions
- small edits and follow-up iterations do not reopen the full discovery flow

## Features

| **Audio design** | Dual-track audio system (SFX beat layer + BGM atmosphere layer), 37 SFX catalog, ffmpeg mixing templates |

## Installation

Clone into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroZ-lab/claritas-design.git ~/.claude/skills/cc-design
```

For Codex-style global installs, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroZ-lab/claritas-design.git ~/.codex/skills/cc-design
```

## Version Awareness

`cc-design` now ships with a root `VERSION` file and a lightweight update checker:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/cc-design/bin/ccdesign-update-check
```

When the skill detects that your local version is stale, it will surface:

```text
UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <local> <remote>
```

The user-facing upgrade path stays unified:

```bash
npx skills update cc-design
```

`cc-design` only detects and prompts. It does not own the upgrade executor.

### Export scripts

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/cc-design/scripts && npm install && cd -
```

This installs `playwright`, `pptxgenjs`, `pdf-lib`. For Playwright-backed export:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

For video and audio export, install ffmpeg (optional dependency):

```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows (via Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg
```

For editable PPTX mode (optional):

```bash
# sharp is an optionalDependency — npm install will attempt it
# If it fails on your platform, editable PPTX falls back to image mode
```

Audio assets (BGM and SFX) are not included in the repository to keep it lightweight. See `references/sfx-library.md` and `references/audio-design-rules.md` for the catalog and download instructions.

## Usage

The skill activates automatically for design-related requests. Example prompts:

```
"Design a landing page for our SaaS product"
"Create a 10-slide pitch deck for the Q3 board meeting"
"Build an interactive prototype of the checkout flow"
"Explore 3 visual directions for the new dashboard"
"Animate this logo reveal with the Takram style"
"Export the deck as editable PPTX"
"Record the animation as a 25fps MP4 video"
"Review this design and score it on 5 dimensions"
```

### Design Style Selection

Mention a style philosophy to set the design direction:

```
"Use the Pentagram style for this infographic"
"Apply Experimental Jetset minimalism to this poster"
"Mix Takram restraint with Locomotive motion for the hero"
```

See `references/design-styles.md` for all 20 philosophy schools.

### Brand Style Cloning

Mention a brand name to load its design system from [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md):

```
"Create a pricing page with Stripe's aesthetic"
"Notion-style kanban board"
"Mix Vercel's minimalism with Linear's purple accents"
```

## Design Workflow

```
Understand → Route → Acquire Context → Design Intent → Build → Verify → Deliver
    │          │           │                │             │        │         │
    ▼          ▼           ▼                ▼             ▼        ▼         ▼
 Batch      Load        Read            6-question    HTML +   3-phase    File
 questions  refs +      design          checklist     React    verify:    delivered
            templates   system          (focal,      comps    structural,
                                     tone, flow,             visual,
                                     spacing,               excellence
                                     color, type)
```

First-turn behavior follows one default path:
- **New ambiguous task** — ask one batched set of clarifying questions
- **New rich brief** — begin with explicit assumptions, then build
- **Explicit speed request** — begin with explicit assumptions, then build
- **Follow-up iteration or minor fix** — act directly unless audience, scope, or output type changes

`SKILL.md` is the runtime behavior contract. `references/workflow.md` supports execution and must not override it.

Two mandatory checkpoints in the Build phase:
- **Before animation** — load animation-best-practices + animation-pitfalls, verify 16 hard rules
- **Before export** — load the relevant export reference, check tool availability and constraints

## Compatibility

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI) | **Primary target** | Playwright MCP + local scripts |
| Codex / OpenAI-compatible | Supported | Prompt metadata in `agents/openai.yaml` |

## Contributing

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/your-feature`)
3. Keep SKILL.md under 200 lines — move new technical content to `references/`
4. Add case studies under `references/case-studies/` with subcategory folders
5. Test with representative design prompts
6. Open a pull request

When adding new reference documents, add a row to the routing table in SKILL.md so the model knows when to load it.

If a pull request changes first-turn behavior, it must also update:
- `SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `references/workflow.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` if the release checklist changes
- `VERSION`
