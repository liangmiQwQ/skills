# Resource Inference

Void automatically detects which Cloudflare resources your project uses by scanning source files at startup. In most cases, there is no manual configuration. Use a resource in code, and Void provisions the matching binding for local development.

## Detected Bindings

| Binding          | Type                       | Detected by import                                                                                                                                               | Detected by env access                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DB`             | `D1Database`               | `import { db } from "void/db"`                                                                                                                                   | `env.DB` or `c.env.DB`                                                         |

| `AI`             | `Ai`                       | `import { ai } from "void/ai"`                                                                                                                                   | `env.AI` or `c.env.AI`                                                         |
| `SANDBOX`        | Managed Sandbox capability | `import { getSandbox } from "void/sandbox"`                                                                                                                      | `getSandbox()`; native Cloudflare also exposes `env.SANDBOX` / `c.env.SANDBOX` |
| Auth             | none                       | `import { ... } from "void/auth"` or `import { auth } from "void/client"` / `void/client/react` / `void/client/vue` / `void/client/svelte` / `void/client/solid` | none                                                                           |

| filename-derived | `DurableObjectNamespace`   | A default-exported `defineDurableState()` module in `durable-objects/`                                                                                           | n/a                                                                            |

Auth detection also triggers when importing the `auth` specifier from `void/client` or a framework-specific client subpath such as `void/client/react` (but not when importing only `fetch`).

Durable state is inferred from files in `durable-objects/`. For example, `durable-objects/shopping-cart.ts` creates the `SHOPPING_CART` binding, exports `ShoppingCartDurableObject`, and records its migration. See [Durable State](../guide/durable-state.md).

## Scanned Directories

### Standard mode

When using Void's built-in routing (no meta-framework), these directories are scanned:

| Directory     | Contains                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `routes/`     | API route handlers                          |
| `middleware/` | Hono middleware                             |
| `queues/`     | Queue consumers                             |
| `pages/`      | Page components and `.server.ts` companions |
| `crons/`      | Scheduled job handlers                      |

### Framework mode

When a meta-framework is detected (TanStack Start, React Router, SvelteKit, Nuxt, or Astro), a broader set of directories is scanned instead:

| Directory | Contains                |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `src/`    | Application source      |
| `app/`    | Framework app directory |
| `routes/` | Framework routes        |
| `server/` | Server-side code        |

Framework detection checks `package.json` for `@tanstack/react-start`, `@react-router/dev`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `nuxt`, or `astro` in dependencies.

For SvelteKit, Nuxt, and Astro, add `voidPlugin()` to the framework's Vite config to enable inference during dev. See [Frameworks Integration](../integrations/frameworks/overview.md) for setup details.

### Always scanned

Regardless of mode, these are always checked:

- **SSR entry** such as `src/main.ssr.ts`, for SSR apps that access bindings during rendering
- **`src/`**, which is always scanned for auth imports unless it is already in the scan list for framework mode
- **`durable-objects/`**, which is scanned for typed Durable Object state modules in native Void apps

## Custom Scan Directories

If your project organizes code in non-standard directories, you can override which directories are scanned:

```json
{
  "inference": {
    "scanDirs": ["src", "lib", "workers"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the project root. When `inference.scanDirs` is set, it replaces the default directories entirely. Defaults for the current mode are not merged in. The SSR entry and `src/` auth scan still apply either way.

## Explicit Binding Overrides

Override individual bindings when inference does not match your setup:

```json
{
  "inference": {
    "bindings": {
      "db": true,
      "kv": true,
      "storage": false,
      "ai": false
    }
  }
}
```

Explicit values override only their named bindings. Omitted bindings continue to be inferred, so setting `kv` does not disable storage, auth, or other features. Auth and checked-in migrations still require a database even when `db` is `false`.

## File Types

Inference scans files matching `**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,js,jsx,mjs}` within each directory. Non-JS files (CSS, HTML, images) are ignored.
