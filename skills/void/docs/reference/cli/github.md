# GitHub and Builds {#github}

Deploy-on-GitHub works from **any** Void login — Google, GitHub, or other SSO. The first time you connect GitHub, Void links your GitHub identity to your current account (a one-time step, independent of how you logged in); it never creates a second account.

## `void github link` {#void-github-link}

```
void github link
```

Link your signed-in Void account to GitHub through your browser. `void github install` does this automatically when needed.

::: warning Existing GitHub sign-in
A GitHub identity can belong to only one Void account. If it is already linked elsewhere, sign in to that Void account or authorize a different GitHub identity.
:::

## `void github install` {#void-github-install}

```
void github install
```

Open the GitHub App install page in your browser. If your account has no linked GitHub identity yet, `void github install` first runs the GitHub link automatically (browser authorize), then continues. After installing, run `void github connect` to link a repository to your project.

## `void github installations` {#void-github-installations}

```
void github installations
```

List all GitHub App installations linked to your account. Each entry includes the `[id: <installation_id>]` needed for `--installation` in non-interactive use.

## `void github join` {#void-github-join}

```
void github join
```

Join an existing organization installation through your browser. `void github connect` can do this automatically in an interactive terminal. Run `join` locally before non-interactive setup when needed.

Requires a signed-in Void account and organization-installation sharing enabled by your platform. Use `void github installations` to find the installation ID.

## `void github connect` {#void-github-connect}

```
void github connect [project] [options]
```

Connect a GitHub repository to a Void project for automatic deploys. On every push to the configured branch, Void builds and deploys your project automatically.

The CLI opens your browser when it needs GitHub authorization. If no installation is available, run `void github install`.

**Options**

| Flag                  | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--project <name>`    | Project name (alias for the positional argument)                                  |
| `--installation <id>` | GitHub App installation ID (required when you have multiple installations)        |
| `--repo <owner/repo>` | Repository full name — required unless the installation grants exactly one repo   |
| `--branch <name>`     | Branch to deploy from — **required in non-interactive mode**                      |
| `--executor <type>`   | Build executor: `container` (default) or `github_actions`                         |
| `--workflow <path>`   | Authorized deploy workflow file — defaults to `.github/workflows/void-deploy.yml` |

Choose `container` for platform builds or `github_actions` for a deployment workflow. The CLI prompts for the executor and, for GitHub Actions, the workflow file. Pass the corresponding flags to skip those prompts.

The workflow must be a `.yml` or `.yaml` file under `.github/workflows/`. Only that workflow can obtain the project's OIDC deployment token. Prefer a dedicated deployment workflow.

For CI, supply the project and branch, plus the installation and repository when they cannot be selected automatically. Organization connections require repository authorization in a local browser first.

```
void github connect my-app \
  --installation 42 \
  --repo owner/my-app \
  --branch main
```

**Project resolution** follows the same order as deploy: positional / `--project`, `VOID_PROJECT`, linked project (`.void/project.json`).

You can connect only repositories your GitHub account can access.

A project has one GitHub connection. Running `void github connect` on a project that is already connected fails. To connect a different repository, run `void github disconnect` first.

## `void github update` {#void-github-update}

```
void github update [project] [options]
```

Change the branch, executor, or workflow for an existing connection. To change the repository, disconnect and reconnect.

**Options**

| Flag                | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--project <name>`  | Project name (alias for the positional argument)                 |
| `--branch <name>`   | New branch to deploy from                                        |
| `--executor <type>` | New build executor: `container` or `github_actions`              |
| `--workflow <path>` | New authorized deploy workflow file (under `.github/workflows/`) |

The CLI prompts for new settings using the current values as defaults. In CI, pass at least one of `--branch`, `--executor`, or `--workflow`.

```
void github update my-app --executor github_actions
```

**Project resolution** follows the same order as deploy: positional / `--project`, `VOID_PROJECT`, linked project (`.void/project.json`).

## `void github status` {#void-github-status}

```
void github status [project]
```

Show the connected repository, branch, executor, and workflow. Container builds do not use the workflow file.

**Options**

| Flag               | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--project <name>` | Project name (alias for the positional argument) |

```
void github status my-app
```

**Project resolution** follows the same order as deploy: positional / `--project`, `VOID_PROJECT`, linked project (`.void/project.json`).

## `void github disconnect` {#void-github-disconnect}

```
void github disconnect [project]
```

Disconnect a project from its GitHub repository, stopping automatic deploys. Any in-flight builds for the project are cancelled (their deploy tokens are revoked) before the connection is removed. If the project has no connection, it reports that and exits successfully. To point a project at a different repository, disconnect first, then run `void github connect`.

You are asked to confirm before anything is removed. Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt; `--yes` is **required** in a non-interactive shell (CI), where there is no prompt to answer.

**Options**

| Flag               | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--project <name>` | Project name (alias for the positional argument)                  |
| `--yes`            | Skip the confirmation prompt (required in non-interactive shells) |

```
void github disconnect my-app --yes
```

**Project resolution** follows the same order as deploy: positional / `--project`, `VOID_PROJECT`, linked project (`.void/project.json`).

## Build {#build}

Inspect Deploy-on-GitHub builds.

### `void build logs` {#void-build-logs}

```
void build logs [build] [--follow] [--output <file>] [--project <slug>]
```

Stream, tail, or download the build logs for a **container** build. With no
`[build]` argument, targets the project's most recent build.

| Flag                     | Purpose                                                                   | Default |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--follow`, `-f`         | Live-tail: poll until the build finishes and its final logs are captured. | off     |
| `--output <file>`, `-o`  | Write logs to a file instead of stdout (appends while following).         | stdout  |
| `--project <slug>`, `-p` | Target project.                                                           | linked  |

**Project resolution** follows the same order as deploy: positional / `--project`,
`VOID_PROJECT`, linked project (`.void/project.json`).

Builds run on **GitHub Actions** keep their logs on GitHub — the command prints
the Actions run URL instead of streaming. Only the last 10,000 log lines of a
container build are retained.

Following waits for the platform to confirm the final log tail. If the platform cannot confirm it, upgrade the platform runtime or read the retained logs without `--follow`. An unfinished final tail reports an error after two minutes; retry to recover it.

Examples:

```
void build logs                     # print the latest build's logs
void build logs -f                  # follow the latest build until it finishes
void build logs bld_123 -o build.log  # download a specific build's logs
```
