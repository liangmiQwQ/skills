## Title

For most projects, maintainers use `squash and merge`. We should follow Conventional Commits for PR title.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The type of PR is decided on the code behavior changes. For example, even if a PR is linked to a `Bug` issue, but it actually adds the missing feature to close it, its type still should be `feat`.

We generally use a lowercase starting imperative sentence as the `<description>` part.

For example

```
feat(cli): add global packages support
```

## PR Setting

If no special requirement provided, submit draft PR.

Always check `Allow edits by maintainers`.

## Description

PR description should always follow simple and human-readable principles.

Avoid excessive headings and checklists when simple paragraphs are enough. Try to use short paragraphs to express your idea and implementation details. Try using sentences like `This PR adds ...`, `The current behavior ...`, `Follows ...'s behavior`, `It means that`, `It doesn't mean that`

If this PR is linked to an issue, put a `Close #xyz` on the top of the description.

For bug fixes without an issue, you should describe the bug first. And then describe this PR's changes.

For projects with `.github/workflows`, we do not need to describe `Validation` part because CI will help verify your implementation.

In order to make the pr description simple and easy to read, we should use simple words and simple sentences. Some well-known project specifications and everyday-chores may also be omitted. (For example, a snap test added in a fix pr, we do not need to mention this addition).

Add a line `🤖 Generated with [The Agent Tool's Name]` in the bottom of the description.

A good PR description should like this, comments should be removed in practice. Paragraphs inside `CORE DESCRIPTION` part can be repeated or skipped as needed.

```markdown
Close #1 <!-- If there is a linked issue -->

<!-- CORE DESCRIPTION START -->

The current ... <!-- Describe a bug or current behavior if no issue linked-->

This PR adds ... <!-- Describe behavior changes if there is -->

This PR includes ... <!-- Describe implement details if it is worth telling like refactor, module movements,especially for chore/refactor PR -->

No behavior changes. <!-- If this is a chore/refactor PR -->

<!-- CORE DESCRIPTION END -->

🤖 Generated with [Agent Name] <!-- Replace [Agent Name] with the tool you're using, e.g. Codex / Claude Code. -->
```

## Follow-up processing

After you set up your PR, you may be required to change some details, you can create new commits or just leave the changes unstaged, but do not modify the existing commits.
