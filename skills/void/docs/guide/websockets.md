# WebSockets

::: warning ⚠️ Void Apps Only
Typed WebSocket routes currently work in native Void apps. They aren't available in meta-framework mode yet.
:::

Create a `.ws.ts` route to send typed messages between your server and connected clients. Each route instance has its own Cloudflare Durable Object for shared state. WebSocket routes require the Cloudflare target.

For example, `/rooms/[id]` gives each chat room its own instance. Use it for chat, presence, collaborative documents, or notifications.

## Route files

Create WebSocket routes in `routes/` with the `.ws.ts` suffix:

```text
routes/
  chat/[room].ws.ts
  notifications.ws.ts
```

Filename rules match regular server routes:

- `index.ws.ts` becomes the parent path
- `[id].ws.ts` becomes `:id`
- `[...slug].ws.ts` becomes a catch-all
- route groups like `(marketing)/chat.ws.ts` are ignored in the URL
- `chat.dev.ws.ts` / `chat.prod.ws.ts` restrict the route to one environment

The environment suffix goes **before** `.ws`. `chat.ws.dev.ts` is not recognised.

## `defineRoom()`

Use `defineRoom()` when clients should share a room or document identified by the route.

```ts
// routes/chat/[room].ws.ts
import * as v from 'valibot';
import { defineRoom } from 'void/ws';

const ClientMessage = v.variant('type', [
  v.object({ type: v.literal('chat.message'), text: v.string() }),
]);

const ServerMessage = v.variant('type', [
  v.object({
    type: v.literal('chat.message'),
    id: v.string(),
    text: v.string(),
    userId: v.string(),
  }),
  v.object({ type: v.literal('chat.joined'), userId: v.string() }),
]);

export default defineRoom({
  messages: {
    client: ClientMessage,
    server: ServerMessage,
  },
  onBeforeConnect(ctx) {
    if (!ctx.user) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
    }
  },
  async onConnect(ctx) {
    await ctx.room.broadcast({ type: 'chat.joined', userId: ctx.user!.id }, [ctx.connection.id]);
  },
  async onMessage(ctx, event) {
    await ctx.room.broadcast({
      type: 'chat.message',
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      text: event.text,
      userId: ctx.user!.id,
    });
  },
});
```

`defineRoom()` adds room helpers to the hook context:

- `ctx.room.broadcast(event, excludeIds?)`
- `ctx.room.getConnections()`
- `ctx.room.getConnection(id)`
- `ctx.connection.send(event)`
- `ctx.connection.close(code?, reason?)`
- `ctx.connection.setState(data)`

## `defineWebSocket()`

Use `defineWebSocket()` when each connection is handled independently instead of as a shared room.

```ts
// routes/notifications.ws.ts
import * as v from 'valibot';
import { defineWebSocket } from 'void/ws';

export default defineWebSocket({
  messages: {
    client: v.object({ type: v.literal('notifications.ack'), id: v.string() }),
    server: v.object({ type: v.literal('notifications.item'), title: v.string() }),
  },
  onBeforeConnect(ctx) {
    if (!ctx.user) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
    }
  },
  async onConnect(ctx) {
    await ctx.socket.send({ type: 'notifications.item', title: 'Connected' });
  },
});
```

## Client

Use `connect()` from `void/ws` on the client:

```ts
import { connect } from 'void/ws';

const socket = connect('/chat/:room', {
  params: { room: 'general' },
});

socket.on('message', (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'chat.message') {
    console.log(event.text);
  }
});

socket.send({ type: 'chat.message', text: 'hello' });
```

`connect()` resolves relative URLs against the current origin and automatically uses `ws:` or `wss:`. It also buffers messages until the socket opens and reconnects by default.

## Typed messages

Define schemas for messages sent by the client and server:

- `messages.client` validates what the browser may send
- `messages.server` validates what the server may send
- `onMessage()` receives the parsed, validated client event
- `ctx.room.broadcast()`, `ctx.connection.send()`, and `ctx.socket.send()` are typed from `messages.server`
- `connect()` infers route params, outgoing client messages, and incoming server messages from generated route types

Messages are JSON events. Raw string and binary messages are not supported.

## Authentication

When Void auth is enabled, every WebSocket hook receives the current user as `ctx.user`, or `null` for an anonymous connection. Use `onBeforeConnect` to reject unauthenticated clients.

## Hooks

Both `defineRoom()` and `defineWebSocket()` support:

- `onBeforeConnect(ctx)`: return a `Response` to reject the upgrade
- `onConnect(ctx)`: runs after the socket is accepted
- `onMessage(ctx, event)`: receives the validated client event
- `onClose(ctx, details)`: receives `{ code, reason, wasClean }`
- `onRequest(ctx)`: handles ordinary HTTP requests to the same path

Void completes the WebSocket close handshake automatically. Use `onClose` for application cleanup;
you do not need to close the socket again in this hook.

Every hook receives a context with:

- `ctx.id`: deterministic route instance id
- `ctx.params`: matched route params
- `ctx.user`: resolved auth user or `null`
- `ctx.request`
- `ctx.env`
- `ctx.storage`

If a route does not define `onRequest()`, non-WebSocket requests return `426 Upgrade Required`.

## Move a route while keeping its state

Before moving a deployed route, run `void info`. For `routes/chat/[room].ws.ts`, the output includes:

```text
To preserve this resource when moving its code, add this to 'defineRoom':
  name: "chat-room",
```

Add the displayed name to your existing definition:

```ts
export default defineRoom({
  name: 'chat-room',
  messages: { client: ClientMessage, server: ServerMessage },
  // Keep your existing hooks.
});
```

Move the file to `routes/rooms/[room].ws.ts`, update clients to connect to `/rooms/:room`, and deploy normally. Keep the same parameter names and values: room `general` still uses its existing storage. The Worker class, binding, and migration history stay the same on both Cloudflare and Void platform deployments.

Both `defineRoom()` and `defineWebSocket()` accept optional `name`. Use a static string, inline or in a local `const`. Each route must produce a distinct Worker class; changing the name selects a different resource. If you already moved a route, `void info` also shows unmatched identities recorded in `void.lock.json`. Identify the original resource before adopting its suggested name; otherwise restore the original source and discover the name there.

### Rename a route parameter

By default, the instance key includes parameter names. `/chat/:room` with `room: 'general'` uses `room=general`; a route without parameters uses `default`. Multiple parameters are joined in route order, for example `team=acme&room=general`. If a multi-parameter route has a value containing `&`, its key uses a versioned encoding to keep rooms separate.

When upgrading an existing multi-parameter route with `&` in its parameter values, those rooms start with isolated storage. The previous storage is retained, but may have been shared by multiple rooms. Migrate only data whose ownership you have verified into each new room. Single-parameter rooms and multi-parameter rooms without `&` keep their existing identities.

If you also rename `[room]` to `[id]`, preserve the old key explicitly:

```ts
// routes/rooms/[id].ws.ts
export default defineRoom({
  name: 'chat-room',
  key: ({ params }) => `room=${params.id}`,
  messages: { client: ClientMessage, server: ServerMessage },
  // Keep your existing hooks.
});
```

Clients now connect to `/rooms/:id` with `params: { id: 'general' }`. The key remains `room=general`, so storage and `ctx.id` stay the same. Returning only `params.id` would select a different instance.

`key` is optional on both WebSocket helpers. It must return a string synchronously and consistently for the same parameters. Preserve the complete old key when migrating multiple parameters. Keep the callback stable after deployment.

## Constraints

Each socket connects to one route instance. To switch rooms, close the current connection and open another. For publishing to multiple topics, see [Live Event Streams](./live.md).

## Deployment

WebSocket routes work on Cloudflare and Void platform deployments. Commit `void.lock.json` when Void adds a binding or migration. Do not delete or reorder deployed migration steps.
