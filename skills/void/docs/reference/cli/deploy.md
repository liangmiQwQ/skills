# Deployment {#deploy}

## `void deploy` {#void-deploy}

```
void deploy [--project <name>] [--dir <path>] [--spa] [--skip-build] [--debug]
void deploy [--platform <cloudflare|void>] [--require-email]
void deploy --platform cloudflare --atomic
```

Auto-detects your project type and chooses the right pipeline. See [Supported App Types](../../guide/app-types.md) and [Deployment](../../guide/deployment.md) for details.

Deploying to a Void platform requires an explicit connection with `void connect <url>`.
A saved project URL or `VOID_API_URL` alone does not establish a connection.
In fresh CI environments, run `void connect "$VOID_API_URL" --no-login` first.

On an upgraded Void platform, an accepted deployment continues if the CLI disconnects. The CLI automatically reconnects to its progress. Pressing Ctrl+C stops observation; use `void project cancel` to request cancellation and `void project status` to inspect the result. If interrupted execution requires recovery, wait for its result before deploying again.

The CLI reports stalled progress and automatic recovery, and waits up to 30 minutes after acceptance. If it times out, the deployment can continue; check `void project status` before trying another deployment.

For an existing Void Worker, `void deploy` can link the Worker and migrate its root Cloudflare config. Keep the first deployment focused on the existing app. See [Deploy an existing Worker](../../integrations/cloudflare.md#deploy-an-existing-worker) for requirements and the ISR cache choice.

For Drizzle projects, deploy performs a read-only schema drift check. If a new migration would be generated, deploy stops and tells you to run `void db generate`, review the migration, commit it yourself, and rerun `void deploy`.

| Flag                            | Purpose                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--platform <cloudflare\|void>` | Override the platform stored in `.void/project.json`                                               |
| `--project <name>`              | Target a specific Void project by slug; not supported with `--platform cloudflare`                 |
| `--dir <path>`                  | Deploy a pre-built static directory (skips build)                                                  |
| `--spa`                         | Use SPA mode instead of SSG for static deploys                                                     |
| `--skip-build`                  | Skip the build step; on Cloudflare this is supported for static/SPA/SSG deploys only               |
| `--require-email`               | Fail when email cannot be set up instead of deploying without it; requires `--platform cloudflare` |
| `--atomic`                      | Publish an existing Durable Object Worker directly; readiness is checked after traffic changes     |
| `--debug`                       | Mirror the structured deploy log to stderr (also written to `~/.void/logs/`)                       |

`--atomic` applies to one deployment. For an existing Durable Object Worker that consistently cannot stage, set `deploy: { cloudflare: { mode: 'atomic' } }` in `void.config.ts` so plain `void deploy` uses atomic publication. The default is `staged`.

Every deploy writes a JSONL log to `~/.void/logs/`. Failures print the log path and relevant details. Use `--debug` or `VOID_DEPLOY_DEBUG=1` to mirror it to stderr.

Keep credentials out of build commands and register them as CI secrets so your CI provider can mask them in logs.

Platform resolution precedence:

1. `--platform <cloudflare|void>`
2. `platform` in `.void/project.json`
3. Void for projects initialized by an older SDK without a saved platform

Selecting Skip deployment setup stores `"platform": "none"`; a later `void deploy` stops with guidance until a platform override is provided.

For the Void platform, project resolution precedence is:

1. `--project <name>`
2. `VOID_PROJECT`
3. linked project in `.void/project.json`

If no project is linked and no override is provided, CLI prompts to link or create one. In CI (non-TTY), `void deploy` errors out instead — set `VOID_PROJECT` or pass `--project <slug>`.

To deploy to another connected Void platform for one invocation:

```sh
void connect https://second.example.com
VOID_API_URL=https://second.example.com void deploy --platform void --project my-app
```

`VOID_API_URL` selects the platform and `--project` selects its project. You must
name the project when overriding a different platform's saved link. Existing
project links and deployment preferences remain unchanged, even when the target
project is created. The same applies to `VOID_PROJECT` and to another project on
the current platform. A first deployment still links the project when no destination
is configured. See [Deploy to another Void platform](../../guide/deployment.md#deploy-to-another-void-platform).

## `void deploy --platform cloudflare` {#void-deploy-platform-cloudflare}

Build and deploy to your Cloudflare account using `void.config.ts`:

```sh
void deploy --platform cloudflare
void deploy --platform cloudflare --require-email   # fail instead of deploying without email
```

Void signs you in through your browser when needed and saves the selected account. In CI, set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and, if the token can access several accounts, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.

| Option or setting              | Cloudflare behavior                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dir`, `--spa`               | Deploy static output through a small Worker and Workers Assets                         |
| `--skip-build`                 | Reuse existing static, SPA, or SSG output; unavailable for Worker apps                 |
| `--project`                    | Unavailable; the Worker and account come from `void.config.ts` and `void.lock.json`    |
| Named environments             | Unavailable; use the top-level `cloudflare` config                                     |
| `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SUBDOMAIN` | Needed in fresh CI when versions have no preview URL; cached locally after a deploy    |
| `--require-email`              | Fail instead of deploying without email when the email step cannot run, as in CI       |
| `DATABASE_URL`                 | Required in the deploy environment for PostgreSQL or MySQL provisioning and migrations |

The token needs Workers Scripts: Edit, read access to bound resources, and edit access to products Void provisions. Commit `void.lock.json` after the first deploy before using other machines or CI.

Use `void secret put <NAME>` for production server values. Local `.env` values are never deployed. Run `void db generate` and commit schema changes before deploying.

Sandbox requires [Workers Paid](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/plans), Docker, and Containers access. API tokens need Account / Containers: Edit and Account / Cloudchamber: Edit.

For email, set `email.from` and run `void email setup --platform cloudflare` locally. Commit the lock file and pass `--require-email` in CI. See [Email setup](../../guide/email/domains.md#your-own-cloudflare-account).

For Access credentials, Hyperdrive permissions, readiness, and rollback, see [Cloudflare deployment](../../integrations/cloudflare.md#deploy-to-your-own-cloudflare-account).
