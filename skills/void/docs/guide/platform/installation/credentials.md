# Credentials

Keep one password-manager entry for this platform. Paste the saved values into the installer when asked; most do not need shell environment variables.

## Cloudflare API Tokens {#runtime-token-permissions}

For a domain installation or Cloudflare Access setup, the installer guides you through creating separate management and runtime tokens using Cloudflare's [API token setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/). Its links preselect the permissions and suggest names based on your platform's display name. Scope the tokens to your selected account and, when using a domain, its zone, save them in your password manager, and paste them into the masked CLI prompts.

For workers.dev testing with the default API hostname, browser login can authorize
infrastructure setup. Void also checks account-wide Access requirements; if the
current credential cannot read them, the installer asks for a scoped Access token.
Protected apps and public apps under Default-Deny need an ongoing app-management
token, stored encrypted. Access setup requires a management token even on
workers.dev. Skip zone permissions until you add a domain.

Browser login does not grant AI Gateway access. Include **Account → AI Gateway → Edit** on the runtime token so Void can verify and create that resource.

The management token lets your CLI install and maintain the platform. The runtime token is stored as a Worker secret so the platform can deploy apps after you close your terminal. They are separate credentials.

Compare each token's form with the permission checklist below, and select the indicated account and zone for a domain installation. The installer saves a management token entered at the prompt in this installation’s encrypted local checkpoint and reuses it on resume. Upgrades, repairs, and other lifecycle maintenance also use that saved management token. During installation, a rejected token can be replaced at the prompt. An explicit `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` or `CF_API_TOKEN` takes precedence. Keep your password-manager copy for maintenance or another machine; scripts supply it through `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.

::: details Permissions to select for each token

Use the following permissions for the core platform. Cloudflare may label write access as **Edit** or **Write**, depending on the token screen; see its [permission reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/).

| Scope   | Permission         | Management | Runtime                                 |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Account | Account Settings   | Read       | Read                                    |
| Account | Workers Scripts    | Edit       | Edit                                    |
| Account | Workers Tail       | Read       | Read                                    |
| Account | D1                 | Edit       | Edit                                    |
| Account | Workers KV Storage | Edit       | Edit                                    |
| Account | Workers R2 Storage | Edit       | Edit                                    |
| Account | Queues             | Edit       | Edit                                    |
| Account | Hyperdrive         | Write      | Write                                   |
| Account | Account Analytics  | Read       | Read                                    |
| Account | AI Gateway         | Edit       | Edit when installing with browser login |
| Zone    | Zone               | Read       | —                                       |
| Zone    | DNS                | Edit       | —                                       |
| Zone    | Workers Routes     | Edit       | —                                       |
| Zone    | Cache Purge        | —          | Purge                                   |

When Void configures Access in the installation account, the initial management-token link also selects **Account → Access: Apps and Policies → Edit** and **Account → Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups → Read**. Protection adds **Account → Access: Service Tokens → Edit**. When the authentication configuration or saved setup selects existing applications, the link requests Read access instead of Edit. These permissions belong to the management token; the runtime token does not need them.

The management token also needs **Zone Edit** with authority to create zones if you ask Void to create the zone. If it already exists, use the selected zone with Zone Read and DNS Edit. Nested application domains additionally need **SSL and Certificates: Read** on the management token. A custom runtime that enables custom project domains needs **SSL and Certificates: Edit** on the runtime token; the core runtime does not enable that feature.

Void checks access before provisioning. If it reports a missing permission, update the token's permissions for the selected account or zone and retry.

## Enable Email {#enable-email}

Choose a shared sender domain and its Cloudflare zone ID. The mail zone may differ from the application zone, but it must belong to the platform's Cloudflare account. To enable email on an existing installation, run:

```sh
VOID_EMAIL_SENDER_DOMAIN=mail.example.com \
VOID_EMAIL_SHARED_ZONE_ID=your-zone-id \
void platform upgrade your-installation-id
```

Set the same two variables before `void platform install` to enable email during a new installation. Void records the pair for later upgrades; an ordinary upgrade cannot replace it.

Before installing, enable [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/get-started/route-emails/) for the exact shared sender domain and confirm that its MX records point to Cloudflare. For a subdomain, add that name under the zone's **Email Routing → Settings → Subdomains**. Cloudflare adds the required MX and SPF records. The installer's shared-mail bootstrap verifies those records; it does not add them. Keep existing mail-provider records on other domain names in place.

Enabling email lets administrators [register email domains for projects](/guide/platform/administration/email#registering-email-domains-for-projects) and lets projects register destination addresses through the runtime token. That needs **Email Routing Addresses: Edit** and **Email Sending: Edit** on the account, plus **Zone: Read**, **Zone Settings: Edit** and **Email Routing Rules: Edit** on the zones that will carry mail. The runtime-token link preselects them when email is enabled. Email Sending onboarding for arbitrary recipients needs Workers Paid.

The installer deploys the email gateway, prepares the shared mail route, and verifies inbound readiness before opening platform traffic. If setup fails, correct the reported permission, exact-domain MX records, or routing conflict, then rerun the same install or upgrade command. A fresh install resumes with `void platform install --resume --name <installation-id>`; it continues the recorded email operation after the configuration is corrected.

## R2 Upload Credentials

In the **R2 token creation** form opened by the installer, select **Object Read & Write** and **Apply to all buckets in this account (including newly created buckets)**. Create an account token, or a user token if your role requires it. Save its **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in your password manager. These differ from the management and runtime API tokens. See [R2’s token instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/).

## Signing and Encryption Keys {#signing-and-encryption-keys}

The **JWT signing key** signs platform login tokens. The **Project encryption key** encrypts app secrets stored by your platform. Generate a separate key for each by running this command twice:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Save each result in your password manager, then paste it into the corresponding installer prompt. The command generates 32 random bytes encoded as base64, suitable for either field. Keep the two original keys for recovery; do not regenerate them when resuming or upgrading.

::: details Generate the keys without printing them to your terminal

On macOS, this copies a suitable random value to the clipboard:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 | pbcopy
```

Paste it into your password manager as **JWT signing key**. Run the command again and save the second value as **Project encryption key**. On PowerShell, use `Set-Clipboard` instead of `pbcopy`. If OpenSSL is unavailable, use your secret manager's secure generator for 32 random bytes in base64, or `node -e 'process.stdout.write(require("node:crypto").randomBytes(32).toString("base64"))'`.

:::

When email is enabled, Void also creates an independent **Email signing key** for confirmation links and service-to-service email requests. The installer keeps it in encrypted recovery state. Set `VOID_PLATFORM_EMAIL_SIGNING_SECRET` to a separate value of at least 32 random bytes when you need an externally custodied copy, including a headless installation whose local recovery files will not persist.
