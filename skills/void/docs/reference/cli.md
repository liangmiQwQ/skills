# CLI Reference {#cli}

`void` is a local binary from the installed `void` package.

Use this page as a command reference. If you are setting up a project for the first time, start with [Quickstart](../guide/quickstart.md) and come back here when you need exact command behavior or flags.

## Binary Invocation {#binary-invocation}

The docs use `void` for brevity. Outside package scripts, run it with your package manager: `npx void`, `pnpm void`, `yarn void`, or `bunx void`.

Alternatively, you can add `./node_modules/.bin` to your `PATH` so that you can invoke `void` directly when you are in the root directory of your app.

:::warning ⚠️ Prefer local install
Install `void` in your project so the CLI and runtime use the same version.

## Help {#help}

```
void --help
void help
void help <command>
void help <group> <command>
void <command> --help
void <group> <command> --help
void <group> help <command>
```

Use `void --help` for the command list, or `void deploy --help` for a specific command. Help is available without signing in or setting up a project.
