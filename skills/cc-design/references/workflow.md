# Workflow: Supporting Guide for Question-First Delivery

This file supports `SKILL.md`. It does not define an independent product workflow.

The runtime contract lives in `SKILL.md`:
- new ambiguous tasks start with structured step-by-step confirmation
- richly specified briefs can skip most clarification, but still require a visible plan
- follow-up iterations and minor fixes act directly unless scope changes

Use this file to structure the step-by-step confirmation flow and the follow-through after that decision has already been made.

## Relationship to 8-Layer Design Framework

This workflow is the **execution process**. The 8-layer framework (`design-thinking-framework.md`) is the **thinking structure**.

**Mapping:**

| Workflow Step | 8-Layer Framework | Purpose |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Step 1: Understand** (Structured confirmation) | Layer 1 (Goal) + Layer 2 (Information) | Clarify objectives, audience, scope, information priorities |
| **Step 2: Route** (Load references) | Layer 2-7 (task-dependent) | Load theory and patterns for relevant layers |
| **Step 3: Acquire Context** (Design system/brand) | Layer 6 (Brand) + Layer 7 (System) | Understand existing constraints and brand personality |
| **Step 4: Plan** (Visible execution plan) | Layer 1-7 (condensed) | Turn confirmed facts and assumptions into a build plan |
| **Step 5: Approval** (Manager review) | Layer 8 (Validation) | Confirm direction before expensive execution |
| **Step 6: Design** (Build artifacts) | Layer 3 (Structure) + Layer 4 (Interaction) + Layer 5 (Visual) | Execute structure, interaction, and visual design |
| **Step 7: Verify** (Check quality) | Layer 8 (Validation) | Test technical feasibility, usability, design quality |
| **Step 8: Iterate** (Refine based on feedback) | Layer 8 → Layer 1 (feedback loop) | Use validation results to refine goals and execution |

**When to use which:**
- **Use workflow.md** for step-by-step execution guidance
- **Use design-thinking-framework.md** when you need to diagnose problems, resolve conflicts, or understand "why" behind decisions
- **Use both together** for complex multi-screen flows or design system creation

## Runtime Load Announcements

Treat runtime loading as visible work, not invisible thought. `load-manifest.json` is the source of truth for route bundles, checkpoint bundles, and optional inspiration bundles. Bundle matching is done by an Agent subagent that reads the catalog from `scripts/generate-bundle-catalog.mjs` and semantically matches the user's prompt. `scripts/resolve-load-bundles.mjs` is kept as a keyword-based fallback.

Rules:
- announce before reading runtime references or copying templates
- use the exact line format: `Load: because=<reason> loaded=<comma-separated paths>`
- if the bundle is already loaded, say `Load: because=<reason> already_loaded=<comma-separated paths>`
- use stable reasons from `load-manifest.json` such as `all-design-tasks`, `question-first-delivery`, `deep-design-review`, `react-prototype`, `before-animation`, `before-delivery`
- do not announce ordinary codebase reads that are not part of the skill runtime bundle
- do not silently skip bundle loads; explicit dedupe is part of the contract

Bundle classes:
- **Base-required bundles (`基础必载`)** — always load for every design task
- **Conditionally required bundles (`条件命中后必载`)** — load when a `taskType` or `checkpoint` is triggered
- **Truly optional inspirations (`真正可选`)** — load only when case-study inspiration helps

## Two-Stage Routing

Use a two-stage route instead of loading every plausible reference up front.

**Stage 1: Base-required load**
- always load `all-design-tasks`
- if the task is new or underspecified, also load `question-first-delivery`

**Stage 2: Route-shaping questions**
- ask the fixed question batch below
- map those answers directly to `taskTypes` and `checkpoints`
- only after explicit mapping, use semantic matching to supplement unresolved `taskTypes` or `optionalInspirations`

This keeps typography, layout, and visual/color theory in the default context while preserving conditional loading for brand, interaction, export, animation, device mockups, and review work.

## First-Turn Rule

Treat this as supporting guidance, not an override:

- **Use structured confirmation** for new tasks with missing audience, scope, output shape, hard constraints, or reference context
- **Skip most questions** only when the brief is already rich, or the user explicitly asks to move fast
- **Act directly** for follow-up iterations and minor fixes

If you are unsure which path applies, default to the next blocking confirmation step. Do not invent a fourth path.

## The Art of Asking Questions

Ask **in steps**, not as a long unstructured dump.

Default target:
- 3 to 4 confirmation steps

Preferred shape:
- 1 blocking question per step
- 2 to 4 short options
- optional freeform when the platform supports it

Fallback:
- if the platform has no structured question UI, compress these steps into one compact batch message

After the steps:
- stop once blocking fields are resolved
- ask at most one open follow-up round if critical details remain
- if critical fields are still unknown after that, convert them into explicit assumptions in the visible plan

Critical blocking fields:
- output shape
- audience
- scope
- hard constraints that would materially change the direction
- reference source, or an explicit "no reference"
- success criteria
- existing contract update mode (`DESIGN.md`: append / merge / overwrite) when relevant

Non-blocking fields:
- optional refinements
- tweak controls
- secondary taste preferences

## Required Question Checklist

When you are in the question-first path, ask these **route-shaping questions first** and stop once bundle selection is clear:

### 1. Output Type

- What is the first artifact: page, deck, clickable prototype, animation, design system, critique, or export target?
- Route mapping:
  `page → landing-page`
  `deck → slide-deck`
  `clickable prototype → interactive-prototype`
  `animation → animation-motion`
  `design system → design-system-creation`
  `critique/review/audit → deep-design-review`
  `pdf/pptx/video target → pdf-export` / `editable-pptx-export` / `video-export`

### 2. Task State

- Is this a new task, a localized edit, or an approved follow-up iteration?
- Route mapping:
  `new or underspecified → question-first-delivery`
  `localized edit / approved follow-up → skip question-first unless scope changed`

### 3. Available Context

- Is there an existing design system, UI kit, codebase, screenshots, or a brand reference?
- Is there an existing `DESIGN.md` or equivalent contract file?
- Route mapping:
  `brand reference / clone → brand-style-clone`
  `need real assets/logo sourcing → brand-asset-acquisition`
  `no references → no-design-system`

**If there is already a `DESIGN.md`:**
- Ask how to update it before touching it
- Required mode selection: **Append / Merge / Overwrite**
- Recommend **Merge** by default
- Do not silently rewrite the file just because a new direction sounds better

### 4. Interaction, Device, and Export Constraints

- Does the task need interaction, an iOS/Android frame, or export output?
- Route mapping:
  `interactive flow → interactive-prototype` or `interaction-design`
  `iOS → mobile-mockup + before-ios-mockup`
  `PDF / PPTX / video → matching export task type + before-export`

### 5. Primary Design Risk

- What is most likely to go wrong: layout, typography, color, information hierarchy, interaction, or brand tone?
- Route mapping:
  `layout → layout-problems`
  `typography → typography-problems`
  `color → color-problems`
  `information hierarchy → information-architecture`
  `interaction → interaction-problems`
  `brand tone → brand-tone`

## After Routing Is Locked

After bundle selection is clear, ask only the remaining blocking product questions. For example:

**Building a landing page**:
- What is the target conversion action?
- Primary audience?
- Competitor references?
- Who provides the copy?

**Building an iOS App onboarding**:
- How many steps?
- What does the user need to do?
- Skip paths?
- Target retention rate?

**Building an animation**:
- Duration?
- Final use (video asset/website/social)?
- Rhythm (fast/slow/segmented)?
- Key frames that must appear?

## Structured Confirmation Example

When encountering a new task, prefer this structure:

```markdown
Step 1 — Output
What is the first artifact?
- Landing page / marketing page
- Deck / presentation
- Clickable prototype
- Animation / motion study

Step 2 — Task state
What kind of task is this?
- New task
- Localized edit
- Approved follow-up

Step 3 — Context
What should I route around?
- Existing design system / codebase
- Brand reference or clone
- Need asset sourcing
- No references

Step 4 — Constraints
Any special delivery or device constraints?
- Interactive flow
- iOS mockup
- Export PDF / PPTX / video
- No special constraints

Step 5 — Primary risk
Where should I deepen theory?
- Layout / information hierarchy
- Typography
- Color / tone
- Interaction

Step 6 — Plan
Plan
- Goal: ...
- Confirmed facts: ...
- Assumptions: ...
- First artifact: ...
- Variation axes: ...
- Verification: ...

Approve this plan, or tell me what to change before I build.
```

If the platform lacks structured question UI, convert the same flow into one compact text block.

## After the Confirmation Steps

Once the confirmation steps are answered, or once unanswered critical fields have been converted into explicit assumptions, do not move straight into delivery. Produce a visible plan, wait for approval, then build.

### Planning Gate

A task is ready for planning when:
- audience is known or explicitly assumed
- output shape is known
- scope is known
- hard constraints are known
- reference context is known or explicitly absent
- success criteria are known or explicitly assumed

If these are incomplete, keep clarifying. If the user wants speed, compress the questions, but do not skip the plan.

### Execution Plan

Before building, show a short plan:

```html
<!--
Execution plan:
- Goal: ...
- Confirmed facts: ...
- Assumptions: ...
- First artifact: ...
- Variation axes: ...
- Verification: ...

Approve this plan before I continue into the full build.
-->
```

Rules:
- 4 to 6 bullets maximum
- this is visible to the user
- approval is required before the first full build
- rich briefs may skip questioning, but not planning
- do not reopen the full question flow unless audience, scope, or output type changes

### Main Work

After the plan is approved:
- Write React components to replace placeholders
- Create variations (using design_canvas or Tweaks)
- If it's slides/animation, start with starter components
- announce any newly loaded runtime bundle before reading it, even mid-task when a checkpoint triggers
- if you chose the question-first path, route with `question-first-delivery` plus the bundles locked by the route-shaping answers
- if the user asked for critique/review/audit/score, route with `deep-design-review` before judging the work

Show again halfway through. If the design direction is wrong, showing late means wasted work.

### Detail Polish

After the user is satisfied with the overall direction, polish:
- Font size/spacing/contrast fine-tuning
- Animation timing
- Edge cases
- Tweaks panel refinement

### Verification + Delivery

- Use Playwright to screenshot (see `references/verification.md`)
- Open in browser and visually confirm after the **final** edit
- Review the full page **and** every changed section; do not stop at the first viewport
- For responsive work, check at least desktop + one narrow/mobile viewport
- For iterative edits on an existing long page, treat touched sections as mandatory coverage targets
- Never declare "done" from code inspection alone
- Summarize **minimally**: only mention caveats and next steps

## The Deep Logic of Variations

Giving variations is not creating choice paralysis for the user, it is **exploring the possibility space**. Let the user mix and match to arrive at the final version.

### What good variations look like

- **Clear dimensions**: each variation varies on a different dimension (A vs B only changes color, C vs D only changes layout)
- **Gradient**: from "by-the-book conservative version" to "bold novel version" in progressive steps
- **Labels**: each variation has a short label explaining what it's exploring

### Implementation Methods

**Pure visual comparison** (static):
→ Use `assets/design_canvas.jsx`, grid layout side by side. Each cell has a label.

**Multi-option/interaction differences**:
→ Build complete prototypes, switch with Tweaks. For example, building a login page, "layout" is one tweak option:
- Left copy, right form
- Top logo + centered form
- Full-bleed background image + floating form overlay

The user toggles Tweaks to switch, no need to open multiple HTML files.

### Exploration Matrix Thinking

For every design, mentally go through these dimensions and pick 2-3 to give variations on:

- Visual: minimal / editorial / brutalist / organic / futuristic / retro
- Color: monochrome / dual-tone / vibrant / pastel / high-contrast
- Typography: sans-only / sans+serif contrast / all serif / monospace
- Layout: symmetric / asymmetric / irregular grid / full-bleed / narrow column
- Density: sparse breathing / moderate / information-dense
- Interaction: minimal hover / rich micro-interactions / exaggerated large animations
- Texture: flat / layered shadows / textured / noise / gradient

## When Facing Uncertainty

- **Don't know how to proceed**: Honestly say you're unsure, ask the user, or put a placeholder and continue. **Don't fabricate.**
- **User's description is contradictory**: Point out the contradiction, let the user choose one direction.
- **Task is too large to handle at once**: Break into steps, do the first step for the user to review, then proceed.
- **Effect the user wants is technically difficult**: Explain the technical boundary clearly, provide alternatives.

## Summary Rules

When delivering, the summary should be **extremely brief**:

```markdown
✅ Slides completed (10 slides), with Tweaks to switch "night/day mode".

Note:
- Data on slide 4 is fake, waiting for you to provide real data for replacement
- Animation uses CSS transition, no JS needed

Next step suggestion: open in your browser first, tell me if any issues on which page/which part.
```

Don't:
- List the contents of every page
- Repeatedly explain what technology you used
- Brag about how good your design is

Caveats + next steps, done.
