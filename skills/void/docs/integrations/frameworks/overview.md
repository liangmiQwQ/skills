# Meta-Frameworks

Keep your framework's routes and rendering, and add Void for databases, storage, jobs, and deployment. The guides in this section show how to connect each framework to Void.

Add `voidPlugin()` to the framework's Vite config. It detects resource usage, generates database types, manages migrations, and prepares the app for `void deploy`.

TanStack Start and React Router use the Cloudflare Vite plugin provided by Void. SvelteKit, Nuxt, Analog, and Astro use their own Cloudflare adapters. The setup differs, but your framework continues to handle routing and rendering.

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework                             | Package                 | Integration                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [TanStack Start](./tanstack-start.md) | `@tanstack/react-start` | Vite plugin composition. `voidPlugin()` runs alongside the framework plugin. |
| [React Router v7](./react-router.md)  | `@react-router/dev`     | Vite plugin composition. Setup matches TanStack Start.                       |
| [SvelteKit](./sveltekit.md)           | `@sveltejs/kit`         | Vite-based, uses its own Cloudflare adapter                                  |
| [Nuxt](./nuxt.md)                     | `nuxt`                  | Own CLI and build toolchain                                                  |
| [Analog](./analog.md)                 | `@analogjs/platform`    | Vite-based, uses Nitro with Cloudflare preset                                |
| [Astro **v6+**](./astro.md)           | `astro`                 | Own CLI and Cloudflare adapter (v6 required)                                 |

Detection is automatic. The CLI reads your `package.json` dependencies.

## Feature Support

With `voidPlugin()` added to the framework's Vite config, frameworks get most of the same backend/platform features as [Void apps](../../guide/app-types.md#void-apps):

- **Binding inference:** D1, KV, R2, AI, and queues are detected from source code.
- **Typed database:** query types come from your Drizzle schema.
- **Migrations:** local D1 is updated on dev startup, and migrations are validated and deployed with `void deploy`.
- **Runtime helpers:** `void/db`, `void/kv`, `void/storage`, and `void/ai` give you typed access to Cloudflare bindings in dev and production.
- **Auth:** Void-managed auth is not supported in framework mode yet. For now, use Better Auth's official integration for your framework.
- **Cron jobs:** scheduled handlers via the `crons/` directory.
- **Queue consumers:** typed producers and consumers via the `queues/` directory.
- **Revalidation and prerendering:** configure them with [`routing.revalidate`](../../guide/edge/revalidation.md) and [`routing.prerender`](../../guide/edge/prerendering.md) in `void.config.ts`. Void apps can also set these per page in component files.

For framework apps, Void revalidation caches public HTML document responses with both `void deploy` and `void deploy --platform cloudflare`. Client data requests continue to use the framework's own behavior. A response with `Set-Cookie` or `Cache-Control: private`, `no-store`, or `no-cache` is never shared.

Frameworks can also access bindings directly via the framework's own mechanisms (e.g. `platform.env` in SvelteKit, `event.context.cloudflare.env` in Nuxt, `env` from `cloudflare:workers` in Analog, `Astro.locals.runtime.env` in Astro).

## Configuration

### `void.config.ts`

Most configuration is inferred automatically. Use `void.config.ts` to override defaults or fine-tune behavior:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'void/config';

export default defineConfig({
  inference: {
    build: 'nuxt build',
    scanDirs: ['src', 'server', 'lib'],
    bindings: { db: 'MY_DB' },
  },
  routing: {
    prerender: ['/', '/about', '/pricing'],
    revalidate: 60,
  },
});
```

| Field                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inference.build`    | Override the default build command                                                                                                                            |
| `inference.scanDirs` | Directories to scan for binding inference (defaults vary by framework)                                                                                        |
| `routing.prerender`  | Paths to prerender as static HTML at deploy time                                                                                                              |
| `routing.revalidate` | Default revalidation TTL in seconds for cached responses                                                                                                      |
| `inference.bindings` | Override inferred bindings. You only need this if auto-detection is not doing what you want. Accepts `true` or a custom binding name such as `"db": "MY_DB"`. |
| `routing.notFound`   | **Ignored.** SvelteKit, Nuxt, Analog, and Astro pin `not_found_handling` to `"none"` — the framework worker owns unmatched HTML. `void deploy` warns if set.  |

See [Configuration](../../reference/config.md) for the full reference.

### Cloudflare settings

Frameworks that use Cloudflare's dev runtime need their adapters pointed at Void's generated `.void-wrangler.jsonc`. Their setup guides show the adapter options. Define your Cloudflare settings in `void.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'void/config';

export default defineConfig({
  cloudflare: {
    name: 'my-app',
    compatibility_date: '2026-02-24',
    compatibility_flags: ['nodejs_compat'],
  },
});
```

Existing bindings are preserved. D1, KV, and R2 use local placeholder IDs until deployment. For a project connected directly to Cloudflare, importing `void/ai` adds a remote Workers AI binding during development; [Cloudflare login](../../guide/ai.md#local-development) is required to use it. Direct deployments also include the inferred AI binding.

Void combines these settings with inferred bindings and records provisioned resource IDs in `void.lock.json`. Commit both files.

## Deployment

Run `void deploy` to build with your framework and deploy to the selected target. See [Deployment](../../guide/deployment.md) for setup and CI.
